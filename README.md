# SmartLayoverPlanner

Welcome to the SmartLayoverPlanner repository, which contains the demo for the Semantic Kernel lecture by Alon Fliess, Azure AI Platform MVP and Microsoft Regional Director.

## Lecture Summary

In this transformative lecture, we explore how Semantic Kernel is ushering in a new era of software development. As deterministic algorithms alone are no longer sufficient, developers and architects must adopt hybrid solutions that integrate deterministic logic, heuristic approaches, and advanced AI technologies such as generative AI and machine learning.

The lecture delves into the paradigm shift in software engineering, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of building systems that evaluate and manage both non-deterministic results and deterministic logic. With the rise of AI agents generating solutions and validation agents safeguarding and guiding their output, responsible AI practices are becoming central to modern software development.

## Demo Overview

This repository contains the demo showcased during the lecture, illustrating the capabilities of Semantic Kernel. The project seamlessly integrates C# with AI-driven functionalities, enabling developers to create intelligent and adaptable systems.

## Agentic Model

The demos represent an agentic model, where AI agents generate solutions and a management agent that ensure the quality and reliability of these outputs. This model enhances the system's ability to handle complex tasks and adapt to changing environments.

## Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The demo also showcases how to store and use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for user preferences. RAG combines the power of retrieval-based methods with generative models to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses based on user preferences.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and use this demo as a reference for integrating Semantic Kernel into your projects. The demo demonstrates real-world applications of Semantic Kernel, showcasing its potential to revolutionize diagnostics, analysis, and decision-making in sophisticated systems.

## Conclusion

By the end of the session, C# developers and architects will have a deep understanding of the concepts and methodologies driving this paradigm shift. They will leave equipped with the tools and knowledge to harness Semantic Kernel and its capabilities, bridging the gap between conventional programming and the dynamic, AI-powered future of software development.
